My recent research has been mainly working on infectious diseases and vectors, but I still try to get out and do some solid field biology. In 2012, the David Serre lab took a trip down the Cuyahoga River in Ohio. The goal was to have some fun away from the lab bench, but the result was a study that used 50ml of river water and eDNA to explore the biodiversity of the Cuyahoga River Valley.
